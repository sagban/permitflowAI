      "description": "During scheduled maintenance on Tank T-101, a welding operation was initiated without proper safety protocols. The fire watch personnel were not adequately positioned, and combustible materials were present within 15 meters of the work area. A gas test was not performed prior to starting hot work. The fire was quickly extinguished but caused minor damage to insulation materials. No injuries reported.",

The initial gas test showed acceptable levels, but continuous monitoring was not maintained. During the inspection, oxygen levels dropped below 19.5% and the gas monitor alarm activated.
